# Bank Tech Test

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to build a tech test for a bank which allows a user to interact with their bank account, allowing the user to make deposits, withdraws and be able to view their whole statement which gives them a complete list of their debits, credits and total balance.  

## User Stories

Whilst working on the project, I came up with user stories as a good soundboard to figure out how I the account should work from a users standpoint and to also help flesh out how I would want my account interface to work. These were the initial user stories that were used:

- As a client, so I can see how much money I have, I would like to check my balance
- As a client, so I can save my money, I would like to make a deposit
- As a client, so I can get my money from my account, I would like to make a withdraw
- As a client, so I can know my monthly financial transactions, I would like to view a bank statement
